\paragraph{Main}
The main code block runs the entire model. It can access all the global parameters and functions. When the model is run, input data will be requested to be provided. This can be done by pointing to a path or opening the file via the GUI. Next these data will be pre-processed to be in a format suitable for further analysis. The mechanical weathering module is then run, which will retrieve data from the input module as well as from the mineral properties and boundary conditions modules. As soon as grains and rock fragments become available, the chemical weathering module starts and with it the precipitation module. The mass balance module is already taken everything into account and bookkeeping all grains and rock fragments over different grains size classes and mineralogical classes. The user may specify at which time steps an output of the data is requested. The output data can then be post-processed to be presented as graphs and figures.

\paragraph{Input \& pre-processing}
Necessary user input data consists of three parts: modal mineralogy, relative interface frequencies and crystal size distribution. (i) The modal mineralogy contains the volume proportions of the minerals present in the source rock. (ii) The relative interface frequencies contain the fractions of all present mineral interface occurrences. (iii) The crystal size distribution (CSD) provides information on the 3D aspects of the present minerals. When the CSD data is in 1D, it will be transformed to 2D and then to 3D. When the CSD data is in 2D, it will be transformed to 3D (using CSD corrections \cite{Higgins2010}). A fourth, optional input is the chemical composition of the source rock. This can be in element or oxide form and may contain only the bulk or mineral chemical compositions as well. In the latter case, the modal mineralogy can be retrieved from the chemical composition data.

\paragraph{Mineral properties}
The properties of all input minerals and possible output minerals will be stored here. It consists of chemical properties, physical properties and inter-mineral properties. (i) The chemical properties include molar volume, molar mass, mineral formula and weathering rates. All except the latter are fixed properties, meaning that they will be retrieved from literature and will not change during running the model. The weathering rate of a mineral may be influenced by pH, temperature and relief (see boundary conditions). (ii) The physical properties are a mineral’s strength and its density. The former plays a role in intra-crystal breakage (see mechanical weathering). (iii) The ‘inter-crystal properties’ have been separated from the previous ‘intra-crystal properties’ because they relate to properties between different crystals (of possible different mineralogy). Interface strength is the main property here, and will play a role in the inter-crystal breakage during mechanical weathering. \linebreak

The intra- and inter-crystal strengths may be dependent on many factors such as anisotropies in crystal structure changes due to changes in temperature or pressure. A detailed approach to estimate the absolute strengths may be considered as building a model on its own and will thus be estimated here for time-efficiency reasons. The data of Heins (1992) may prove valuable here for estimating relative inter-crystal strengths while intra-crystal strengths may be gathered from literature. Notwithstanding these data, a more detailed approach could be argued here, and may be incorporated in the future. The modular architecture of SedGen will allow for such an adaptation. 

\paragraph{Boundary conditions}
The boundary conditions cover climate and physiography. (i) Climate governs temperature, pH and precipitation, all of which have an influence on chemical weathering rates. A general water availability model could also be incorporated in future work to better assess these influences. (ii) Physiography consist of the relief (in source area) and plays a role in both weathering processes. The general trend here is thus ‘time’ vs. intensity. 

\paragraph{Mechanical weathering}
The pre-processed input data are combined with the mineral properties and boundary conditions during the calculations of the mechanical weathering (as they will with the chemical weathering and clay formation modules). First, the source rock is broken into large rock fragments during ‘intra-rock breakage’. A detailed mass balance is not accounted for these fragments, only their number and size. This can be argued because their compositions will be very similar to the initial conditions. When a large fragment, upon further abrasion, gets below a certain fractionation limit threshold, the detailed mechanical weathering kicks in. If a rock fragment is to be broken, inter-crystal breakage will be applied while if it concerns a (mono-mineralic) grain, intra-crystal breakage will be triggered. Bookkeeping by the mass balance of all grains and rock fragments becomes very important now for further developments of the system (see mass balance module).

\paragraph{Chemical weathering \& precipitation}
Grains and rock fragments resulting from mechanical weathering will be available for chemical weathering and thus will be dissolved. These solutes may remain in this state or may precipitate as authigenic minerals such as oxides or clays. Clay minerals can again be chemically weathered and reenter the system in doing so.

\paragraph{Mass balance}
The mass balance keeps track of all mono crystalline grains, poly crystalline grains (rock fragments), solutes and clay/oxides. The poly crystalline grains are further subdivided in mono mineralic and poly mineralic rock fragments. The accounting is done according to a Lagrangian framework, meaning that where the parts are present in the system is not relevant, only how many (and in which form) of each part is. For the mono crystalline grains a matrix of grain size classes and number frequencies per mineral is sufficient. For the polycrystalline grains a same matrix with number frequencies and grain size classes is combined with a separate matrix with rock fragment sizes.

\paragraph{Output}
Output data consists of grains size distributions, mineralogy and grain number frequencies in the form of the accounting done in the mass balance module. The output of data can be requested (at any time?) by the user to zoom in on output at a specific time step.

\paragraph{Post-processing}
Output data may be post-processed to generate time-evolution figures such as trajectories on ternary diagrams e.g..
