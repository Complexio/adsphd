\chapter{SedGen: design and architecture}\label{ch:sedgen_architecture}

%
% Look at Hobley et al 2017 for a good overview of how to write the backbones for this chapter
%

\section{Design guidelines}
SedGen should be written in a popular programming language. %
The code base should be easily maintainable, while also being in some sort of version control system. %
A modular structure of the code base is also preferable. %


\section{Programming language}
SedGen is written in Python and uses as main packages: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, etc. . %
All of these packages are widely used throughout the scientific community. % (ref to black hole picture?).
\begin{itemize}
    \item Python is easy to use
    \item Python is low-level
\end{itemize}
