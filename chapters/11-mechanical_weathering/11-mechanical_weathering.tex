\chapter{Mechanical weathering}\label{ch:mechanical_weathering}

\section{Chapter contents}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Based on Paredis et al. 2019b publication in which state-of-the-art in mechanical weathering will be discussed
    \item Since this field is less discussed in the geological literature, literature from others research fields will be consulted
    \item Discuss the mechanical weathering module of SedGen
    \item Intra- \& inter crystal breakage along with intra-rock breakage in early stages of simulation (fractionation limit)
    \item Rock fragments on-demand

\end{itemize}
