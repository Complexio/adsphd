\chapter{Input based on modified GGD}\label{ch:input_GGD}

\section{Chapter contents}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Griffiths’ descriptor for sediments
    \item Our translation of Griffiths’ description for granitoids and parent rocks in general (discussion): i) modal mineralogy, ii) relative crystal interfaces, iii) crystal size distributions
    \item Mention the fact that we leave out orientation and shape properties but that these could be included in future versions of SedGen (part of discussion)

\end{itemize}
