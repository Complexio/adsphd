\chapter{Dataset}\label{ch:dataset}

\section{Chapter contents}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Introduction to main data set of Heins (1992): Geological setting of different plutons, number and identity of samples, etc. . %
    \item Introduction to three main ‘building blocks’ of modal mineralogy, relative crystal interfaces and CSD
\end{itemize}

\section{Data from literature}
    \subsection{Data from Heins (1992)}
        The PhD thesis of \Textcite{Heins_1992} was the main source for data of this project. %
        Since it holds detailed data on the mineralogical composition and texture of six granitoid plutons it was very suited to serve as the starting point for this PhD. %
        Later on, the available data would be extended by means of own data collection (see next section). %

    \subsection{Additional data sources}
        Throughout the PhD, other sources for data of various forms has also been used. %
        References to those may be found in the relevant chapters. %

\section{Own data}
    Additional data was gathered to elaborate the dataset already collected by \Textcite{Heins_1992}. %
    The main addition was the digital image analysis carried out over a period of four months. %
    During this analysis, data on crystal size was collected of all available thin sections from \Textcite{Heins_1992}. %
